# Project Plan: ZMK Config and Keymap Editor Integration

This document outlines the plan to create an integrated solution for managing the ZMK configuration and the web-based keymap editor.

## Phase 1: Setup and Integration

- [ ] **Install Dependencies:** Install the necessary dependencies for the `keymap-editor` application.

- [ ] **Connect to GitHub:** Configure the editor to connect to the `zmk-config-totem` repository on GitHub.

## Phase 2: Language Switching Feature

- [ ] **Code Analysis:** Analyze the source code of the `keymap-editor` to understand how it handles keyboard layouts and keycodes.
- [ ] **Implementation:** Design and implement the language switching feature.
- [ ] **Testing:** Test the new feature to ensure it works correctly.

## Phase 3: Integration and Deployment (Future)

- [ ] **Merge Editor:** Decide on a strategy to merge or integrate the keymap editor with the ZMK config repository.
- [ ] **Deployment:** Decide on a deployment strategy for the integrated solution.

# Gemini AI Assistant Instructions

This file provides guidance for AI assistants working on this project.

## Project Overview

This is a ZMK firmware configuration for the Totem split keyboard. The configuration is for a Danish keyboard layout.

## Keyboard Layout

The keyboard layout is Danish. Please be mindful of this when making changes to the keymap.

### Customizations

- The question mark (`?`) is on the `sim_layer` and is activated by `LS(MINUS)`.
- The less than (`<`) and greater than (`>`) keys are on the `sim_layer` and are activated by `NON_US_HASH` and `LS(NON_US_HASH)` respectively.

## Keymap Structure

The keymap is defined in `config/totem.keymap`. It consists of the following layers:

- `base_layer`: The default layer.
- `nav_layer`: Activated by holding the `SPACE` key.
- `sim_layer`: Activated by holding the `ESC` key.
- `adjust_layer`: Activated from the `nav_layer` and `sim_layer`.

## Conventions

- When modifying the keymap, please ensure the ASCII art representation is also updated to reflect the changes.
